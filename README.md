## Overview
Use Python code to process election data from three counties and decide the winning canidate. Program also recorded the total number of votes overall, for each canidate and county, the percentage of votes for each county and each canidate, as well as the county with the largest voter turnout.

- Denver County had the largest voter turnout of 82.8%, with 306,055 votes cast
- Arapahoe County had the smallest voter turnout of 6.7%, with 24,801 votes cast

- Charles Casper Stockham recieved 23% of the vote, with 85,213 votes cast
- Diana DeGette won the election with 73.8% of the vote, with 272,892 votes cast in her favor
- Raymon Anthony Doane recieved only 3.1% of the vote, with 11,606 votes cast

## Summary 
This Python code is straightforward to use, and can easily be modified for use in other elections. This code could easily track other election data such as district votes and party votes. It could even be used to track votes for city council proposals and bills, or to gather data on voter issues.
